          <h2><u>Evie Frye</u></h2>

          <p>
            Evie was born four minutes before her brother Jacob. Due to their mother Cecily's death after childbirth, the twins were raised by their grandmother in Crawley until the age of six, after which they were trained by their father, Ethan Frye, in the ways of the Assassins. Evie relished in her father's lessons and gravitated in planning and research on the Brotherhood, and the Pieces of Eden, unlike the carefree Jacob.

            In her teenage years, Evie used her skills to spy upon Ethan and his father's friend George Westhouse's conversations about the Brotherhood and would relay this information to her brother.

            Early in her career as an Assassin, Evie assassinated her first target, an abusive mill owner who refused to provide adequate wages to his workers. The mill owner was eventually replaced by an Assassin.

            After their father's death in 1868, the twins coordinated with George Westhouse in Croydon, to remove the Templar threat of Rupert Ferris and David Brewster. Having her research and plans for her attack on a Starrick and Co. train yard, Evie deployed a diversion by detaching the train's carriages to infiltrate Brewster's laboratory and recover a Piece of Eden from him and the Templar occultist Lucy Thorne.

            Upon gaining access to the laboratory, Evie assassinated Brewster, who was experimenting with the artifact on a machine and destabilizing it, causing the machine to malfunction and explode. She later returned to Westhouse and Jacob to report her accomplishment. The twins shared impatience on traveling to London, an idea which Westhouse disagreed, warning the siblings that it was not Ethan's wish for them. Adamant to continue her father's legacy, Evie accompanied Jacob in hitching a train heading to London.

            The twins arrived in Whitechapel and decided to seek out the Assassin leader Henry Green who apprised them on the Templar control over London. Evie contradicted her brother's proposal in creating a gang called the Rooks to challenge the Blighters, instead suggesting to recover Pieces of Eden. The trio bumped into the writer Charles Dickens and Blighters thugs. Evie joined her brother in driving a carriage to distract them in chasing Henry, destroying Blighters' carriages in the process. Returning to Henry's shop, the Assassins discussed their contacts within the city.

            They later met with a disguised Frederick Abberline, the Chief of Metropolitan Police Service in a back alley. Abberline gave them a list of notable Blighters members whom they kidnapped. Following this, Evie and Jacob contacted their young ally Clara O'Dea in Babylon Alley for information in exchange for freeing children from labor in the factories. After eliminating the rest of the Blighters and their leader Rexford Kaylock's control of Whitechapel, the duo formed the Rooks.

            The Assassins took ownership of the former Blighters train, making it their hideout, and allied with Agnes MacBean who provided her financial services. Jacob and Evie further traveled to Southwark to meet Alexander Graham Bell, Henry Green's associate, to fix the broken rope launcher and attach it to their Hidden Blade bracers.

            In return for his aid, Evie assisted Bell in setting up a free telegraph line for companies competing against Starrick Telegraph Company to use, by installing new fuses in the Clock Tower of the Palace of Westminster, while at the same time casually suggesting that he rename his invention, the "phonetic telegraph" to the "telephone". Returning to Bell's carriage, the latter showed Evie his smoke bombs and provided her the formula. Evie then made her way to a Blighter stronghold to loot metal components and returned to Bell's workshop. The twins headed to their hideout where they were greeted by Ned Wynert, who gave them his business card. The Assassins began planning their next move, Evie focusing on recovering precursor artifacts.
